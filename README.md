## About The Project

Small React-based mobile app to search for a catalogue of meals that you want to find for cooking. Type the dish that you want and look over a catalogue of all the possible options (e.g. 'Pizza Dough', 'Chorizo, caper & rocket pizza
' or 'Pizza Roll-Up').

Once you liked a particular dish, it's time to watch the ingredients! Click on it and watch the details.
